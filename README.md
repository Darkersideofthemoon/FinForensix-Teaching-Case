FinForensix Teaching Case: Fraud Analytics with Simulated Invoices

Overview

The FinForensix Teaching Case provides a hands-on fraud analytics exercise for accounting students. Using simulated invoice data, students learn to:

Detect anomalies and red flags.

Apply statistical methods (e.g., outlier detection).

Identify duplicate or suspicious transactions.

Compare workflows across Python, Excel, and Alteryx.

Strengthen critical thinking in fraud detection scenarios.

The teaching case is designed for both undergraduate and graduate accounting courses. It aligns with professional standards (CPA Evolution, AACSB) and emphasizes cognitive progression using Bloom’s Taxonomy.

Repository Contents

FinForensixGenerator.ipynb → Jupyter Notebook that generates a synthetic invoice dataset with both legitimate and fraudulent transactions.

Invoice_Basic_Tasks.ipynb → Companion notebook with guided analysis tasks (duplicate detection, round-dollar anomalies, timing tests, etc.).

Sample Dataset (optional) → Generated by the notebook (CSV format).

How to Use
1. Generate the Dataset

Open FinForensixGenerator.ipynb in Jupyter or Google Colab.

Adjust invoice parameters:

num_invoices_to_generate = 500000  
start_date = '2015-01-01'  
end_date = '2024-06-30'  
min_invoice_amount = 100  
max_invoice_amount = 1000  


Change perpetrators by editing the fraudster dictionary in the generator code:

fraudsters = {"Gregory Y Rogers": [], "Hannah U Powell": []}


Add/remove names to modify who generates fraudulent transactions.

2. Analyze the Dataset

Open Invoice_Basic_Tasks.ipynb in Jupyter/Colab.

Run code cells step by step to:

Load the CSV dataset.

Check duplicates.

Identify round-dollar transactions.

Flag outliers (e.g., >2 standard deviations above the mean).

Summarize by customer and year.

Alternative Implementations

Don’t use Python? Parallel workflows are provided:

Excel → Import CSV, clean data, use conditional formatting, pivot tables, and filtering.

Alteryx → Use Input, Select, Summarize, Filter, and Join tools to replicate the fraud-detection logic.
(See Appendix K of the paper for step-by-step tasks.)
